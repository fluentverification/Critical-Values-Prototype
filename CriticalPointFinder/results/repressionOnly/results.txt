Using the threshold generation prototype tool, regarding the reaction rate of LacI
To generate thresholds for a 
Repression only,
100 total count LacI,
with 0 IPTG model


10 generated thresholds using the "cumulative" technique
Using a threshold value of .005:

0 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
8 
12 
62 

10 genearated thresholds using the "non-cumulative" technique
Using a threshold value of .0025:

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10

RESULTS:
Control Model
   For the control model, that is 101 states, 0-100:
   Result: 
      0.8057554207403307 (value in the initial state)

Cumulative Model
   Some tweeking was needed, the max value was some random memory address
   and needed to be changed to 100,
   Also I needed to add the 62 threshold value, the state was there but no
   transition existed to get to 100
   11 states total
   Result: 
      0.8407368957604767 (value in the initial state)

Non-Cumulative Model
   Also some tweeking was needed
   11 states total
   Result: 
      0.999870492010496 (value in the initial state)

Random Model
   I thought this would be interesting to add, 
   I ranomly selected 11 states (I meant to grab 10)
   12 states total
   Result: 
      0.6725923905859837 (value in the initial state)
